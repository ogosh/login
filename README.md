You are asked to extend Django's inbuilt user authentication and login system as follows: 

1. Add the ability for users to add an email address. The first time they login, if they do not have an email added to their profile, they should be prompted to enter an email and then the email should be verified by confirming a URL sent to their email address. Once confirmed, the email address should be added to their profile.
2. Add two factor authentication using the google authenticator app. The first time they login after their email address has been confirmed, they should be taken to a page that shows them a QR code to scan using the Google Authenticator App. This should configure Google Authenticator to work with their account. Afterwards, each time they login they should be asked to enter a code generated by the google authenticator app, which must be verified before completing the login.
